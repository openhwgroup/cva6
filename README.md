CVA6 is a 6-stage, single-issue, in-order CPU which implements the 64-bit RISC-V instruction set. It fully implements I, M, A and C extensions as specified in Volume I: User-Level ISA V 2.3 as well as the draft privilege extension 1.10. It implements three privilege levels M, S, U to fully support a Unix-like operating system. Furthermore, it is compliant to the draft external debug spec 0.13.

It has a configurable size, separate TLBs, a hardware PTW and branch-prediction (branch target buffer and branch history table). The primary design goal was on reducing critical path length.

The CVA6 core is part of a vivid ecosystem. In [this document](RESOURCES.md), we gather pointers to this ecosystem (building blocks, designs, partners...).

A performance model of CVA6 is available in the `perf-model/` folder of this repository.
It can be used to investigate performance-related micro-architecture changes.

# Quick setup

The following instructions will allow you to compile and run a Verilator model of the CVA6 APU (which instantiates the CVA6 core) within the CVA6 APU testbench (corev_apu/tb).

Throughout all build and simulations scripts executions, you can use the environment variable `NUM_JOBS` to set the number of concurrent jobs launched by `make`:
- if left undefined, `NUM_JOBS` will default to 1, resulting in a sequential execution
of `make` jobs;
- when setting `NUM_JOBS` to an explicit value, it is recommended not to exceed 2/3 of
the total number of virtual cores available on your system.    

1. Checkout the repository and initialize all submodules.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6.git
cd cva6
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Install the GCC Toolchain [build prerequisites](util/toolchain-builder/README.md#Prerequisites) then [the toolchain itself](util/toolchain-builder/README.md#Getting-started).

:warning: It is **strongly recommended** to use the toolchain built with the provided scripts.

3. Install `cmake`, version 3.14 or higher.

4. Set the RISCV environment variable.
```sh
export RISCV=/path/to/toolchain/installation/directory
```

5. Install `help2man` and `device-tree-compiler` packages.

For Debian-based Linux distributions, run :

```sh
sudo apt-get install help2man device-tree-compiler
```

6. Install the riscv-dv requirements:

```sh
pip3 install -r verif/sim/dv/requirements.txt
```

7. Run these commands to install a custom Spike and Verilator (i.e. these versions must be used to simulate the CVA6) and [these](#running-regression-tests-simulations) tests suites.
```sh
# DV_SIMULATORS is detailed in the next section
export DV_SIMULATORS=veri-testharness,spike
bash verif/regress/smoke-tests.sh
```

# Directory Structure

The directory structure separates the [CVA6 RISC-V CPU](#cva6-risc-v-cpu) core from the [CORE-V-APU FPGA Emulation Platform](#corev-apu-fpga-emulation).
Files, directories and submodules under `cva6` are for the core _only_ and should not have any dependencies on the APU.
Files, directories and submodules under `corev_apu` are for the FPGA Emulation platform.
The CVA6 core can be compiled stand-alone, and obviously the APU is dependent on the core.

The top-level directories of this repo:
* **ci**: Scriptware for CI.
* **common**: Source code used by both the CVA6 Core and the COREV APU. Subdirectories from here are `local` for common files that are hosted in this repo and `submodules` that are hosted in other repos.
* **core**: Source code for the CVA6 Core only. There should be no sources in this directory used to build anything other than the CVA6 core.
* **corev_apu**: Source code for the CVA6 APU, exclusive of the CVA6 core. There should be no sources in this directory used to build the CVA6 core.
* **docs**: Documentation.
* **pd**: Example and CI scripts to synthesis CVA6.
* **util**: General utility scriptware.
* **vendor**: Third-party IP maintained outside the repository.
* **verif**: Verification environment for the CVA6. The verification files shared with other cores are in the [core-v-verif](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif) repository on GitHub. core-v-verif is defined as a cva6 submodule.


## verif Directories

- **bsp**:     board support package for test-programs compiled/assembled/linked for the CVA6.
This BSP is used by both `core` testbench and `uvmt_cva6` UVM verification environment.
- **regress**: scripts to install tools, test suites, CVA6 code and to execute tests
- **sim**:     simulation environment (e.g. riscv-dv)
- **tb**:      testbench module instancing the core
- **tests**:   source of test cases and test lists
