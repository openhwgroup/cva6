## Experimental Stand-alone testbench for the CVA6
This do-nothing TB supports experiments with the CVA6 to develop a standalone testbench for the CVA6.
It uses a "core-only" manifest file `Flist.cva6`.

### Current status:
Compiles and runs without errors for a few thousand clock cycles under either Verilator, Metrics DSIM or Cadence Xcelium (xrun).

### Give it a try:
```
$ make help
