## Feature: CSRs locked access

### Sub-feature: 000_configure_1_pmp_entry

#### Item: 000

* **Requirement location:** 
* **Feature Description**
  
  {Page 60 Section "Locking and Privilege Mode" Volume II: RISC-V Privileged Architectures V20211203}  
    
  The L bit indicates that the PMP entry is locked, i.e., writes to the configuration register and associated address registers are ignored  
  If PMP entry (i) is locked, writes to pmp(i)cfg and pmpaddr(i) are ignored  
  Locked PMP entries remain locked until the hart is reset  
    
    
  {Page 60 Section "Locking and Privilege Mode" Volume II: RISC-V Privileged Architectures V20211203}  
    
  Setting the L bit locks the PMP entry even when the A field is set to OFF  
    
  Additionally, if PMP entry (i) is locked and pmp(i)cfg.A is set to TOR, writes to pmpaddr(i-1) are ignored
* **Verification Goals**
  
  configure 1 PMP entry (the 1st one) with L=1,  
    - write PMP entry (i) with L=1 in M-mode  
    - A is random, should also be tried with A=OFF when L=1 (to cover feature above)  
    - check PMP entry (i) written value in M-mode  
    - check for PMP entry (i) where L=1 that pmp(i)cfg and pmpaddr(i) are effectively locked (M-mode check only)  
    - also check for PMP entry (i) where L=1 and pmp(i)cfg.A=TOR that pmpaddr(i-1) is effectively locked  
    - apply hart reset  
    - check for PMP entry (i) reset value (read zero) by reading in M mode  
    - write PMP entry (i) in M-mode  
    - check PMP entry (i) written value in M-mode  
    
  REUSABILITY  
    - if possible, the PMP entry number (i) is a configurable parameter  
    - if possible, (L) value is a configurable parameter  
    - so the same sub-functions are reused with varying (i) and (L) parameters

  {https://docs.openhwgroup.org/projects/cva6-user-manual/01_cva6_user/PMP.html}  
   A maximum of 16 PMP entries are supported.  
  All PMP CSRs are always implemented, but CSRs (or bitfields of CSRs) related to PMP entries with number CVA6Cfg.NrPMPEntries and above are hardwired to zero.

  8 PMP entries are implemented
* **Verification Goals**
  
  configure the first 8 PMP entries with L=1  
    - for each PMP entry (i), check once that pmp(i)cfg and pmpaddr(i) can be written and can be read back exactly the same (in M-mode)  
    - apply hart reset  
    - for each PMP entry (i), check once that pmp(i)cfg and pmpaddr(i) can be written and can be read back exactly the same (in M-mode)  
    
  for the last 8 PMP entries, check that pmp(i)cfg and pmpaddr(i) always read zero after being written (in M-mode with L=1)

## Feature: multi entries NA4

### Sub-feature: 000_1_entry

#### Item: 000

* **Requirement location:** 
* **Feature Description**
  
  {Page 57 Section "3.7.1 Physical Memory Protection CSRs" Volume II: RISC-V Privileged Architectures V20211203}  
    
  Up to 64 PMP entries are supported
* **Verification Goals**
  
  choose a single PMP entry  
    
  CONFIGURATION and ACCESS  
      - for each pmp entry, apply any CONFIGURATION+ACCESS scenario above (Cf. Feature: "cfg NA4 access S/U/M")  
      - make sure the pmp entries address ranges are not overlapping/intersecting  
      - NB: obviously, pmp entry configurations with different mstatus.MPRV/MPP values cannot be mixed in same test  
    
  CHECK  
      - for each pmp entry, we should obtain the expected CHECK result  
    
  REUSABILITY  
      - if possible, the number of PMP entries (N) is a configurable parameter  
      - so a single test function can be reused

  Up to 64 PMP entries are supported
* **Verification Goals**
  
  choose any 2 PMP entries  
    
  CONFIGURATION and ACCESS (Cf. Feature: "cfg NAPOT access S/U/M")  
      - for the least-numbered pmp entry, apply any CONFIGURATION+ACCESS scenario without access-fault  
      - for the highest-numbered pmp entry, apply any CONFIGURATION+ACCESS scenario with access-fault  
      - make sure the pmp entries address ranges are overlapping/intersecting (at least at 4 consecutive bytes)  
      - for each pmp entry, execute one access in its associated pmp address region but outside the overlapping/intersecting address range  
      - execute one additional access inside the overlapping/intersecting address range  
      - NB: obviously, pmp entry configurations with different access-modes (S/U vs. M) cannot be easily mixed in same test  
      - NB: obviously, pmp entry configurations with different mstatus.MPRV/MPP values cannot be mixed in same test  
    
  CHECK  
      - for each pmp entry, access outside the overlapping/intersecting address range should give the expected CHECK result  
      - access inside the overlapping/intersecting address range should not generate any access-fault  
    
  REUSABILITY  
      - if possible, the number of PMP entries (N) is a configurable parameter  
      - so a single test function can be reused

### Sub-feature: 005_2_intersecting_entries_succeed

#### Item: 000

* **Requirement location:** 
* **Feature Description**
  
  {Page 57 Section "3.7.1 Physical Memory Protection CSRs" Volume II: RISC-V Privileged Architectures V20211203}  
    
  Up to 64 PMP entries are supported
* **Verification Goals**
  
  choose any 2 PMP entries  
    
  CONFIGURATION and ACCESS (Cf. Feature: "cfg NA4/NAPOT/TOR/OFF access S/U/M")  
      - for the least-numbered pmp entry, apply any CONFIGURATION+ACCESS scenario without access-fault  
      - for the highest-numbered pmp entry, apply any CONFIGURATION+ACCESS scenario with access-fault  
      - make sure the pmp entries address ranges are overlapping/intersecting (at least at 4 consecutive bytes)  
      - for each pmp entry, execute one access in its associated pmp address region but outside the overlapping/intersecting address range  
      - execute one additional access inside the overlapping/intersecting address range  
      - NB: obviously, pmp entry configurations with different access-modes (S/U vs. M) cannot be easily mixed in same test  
      - NB: obviously, pmp entry configurations with different mstatus.MPRV/MPP values cannot be mixed in same test  
    
  CHECK  
      - for each pmp entry, access outside the overlapping/intersecting address range should give the expected CHECK result  
      - access inside the overlapping/intersecting address range should not generate any access-fault  
    
  REUSABILITY  
      - if possible, the number of PMP entries (N) is a configurable parameter  
      - so a single test function can be reused

## Feature: entry reconfiguration

  reuse of feature descriptions (Cf. Feature: "cfg NA4/NAPOT/TOR/OFF access S/U/M")  
  reuse of feature descriptions (Cf. Feature: "CSRs M-mode only")  
  reuse of feature descriptions (Cf. Feature: "CSRs locked access")  
  reuse of feature descriptions (Cf. Feature: "multi entries NA4/NAPOT/TOR/OFF")
* **Verification Goals**
  
  configure any N PMP entries, possibly some with L=1  
    
  CONFIGURATION and ACCESS  
      - for each pmp entry, apply any CONFIGURATION+ACCESS scenario above (Cf. Feature: "cfg NA4/NAPOT/TOR/OFF access S/U/M")
