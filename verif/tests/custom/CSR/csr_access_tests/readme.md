Highlights:

This directory includes test programs for the RISCV CVA6 CSR Access, which are divided into Machine read-write, Machine read-only, Supervisor read-write, and Machine Mode counter CSR tests.

1.Each CSR access has been verified in all priviliged modes(M,S and U).

2.The behavior of counter CSRs has been verified in all priviliged modes (M,S and U).

3.Checked the behavior of the RISC-V Machine mode counter CSRs when it reaches to maximum value.
