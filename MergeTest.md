# Use this file to exercise the GitHub portions of the OpenHW Group workflow

Parts of the [OpenHW Group workflow](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/Common/OpenHWGroup_WorkFlow.pdf)
are modeled after Vincent Driessen's [git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).  When
you first register as a member of OpenHW, you can use this file to safely test whether you have the appropriate user priviledges:
* Clone a development branch of the master-branch.
* Push changes of your development branch to this repository.
* Issue a pull-request to get your updated development branch merged to the master.

When all of that works, you are ready to make contributions to the OpenHW Group CORE-V projects.

If you are new to git, or unfamiliar with using branches and pull-requests, have a look at our [Git Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/blob/master/GitCheats.txt).
