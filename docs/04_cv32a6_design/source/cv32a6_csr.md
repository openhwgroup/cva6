# REGISTERS CSR CV32A6

## Floating-Point Accrued Exceptions Register 
### *AddressOffset*: 1 
### *Description*:
The fields within the ``fcsr`` can also be accessed individually through different CSR addresses, and separate assembler pseudoinstructions are defined for these accesses. The FRRM instruction reads the Rounding Mode field ``frm`` and copies it into the least-significant three bits of integer register *rd*, with zero in all other bits. FSRM swaps the value in frm by copying the original value into integer register *rd*, and then writing a new value obtained from the three least-significant bits of integer register *rs1* into ``frm``. FRFLAGS and FSFLAGS are defined analogously for the Accrued Exception Flags field ``fflags``.

### *AddressOffset*: 2 
### *Description*:
The fields within the ``fcsr`` can also be accessed individually through different CSR addresses, and separate assembler pseudoinstructions are defined for these accesses. The FRRM instruction reads the Rounding Mode field ``frm`` and copies it into the least-significant three bits of integer register *rd*, with zero in all other bits. FSRM swaps the value in frm by copying the original value into integer register *rd*, and then writing a new value obtained from the three least-significant bits of integer register *rs1* into ``frm``.

The FRRM instruction reads the Rounding Mode field ``frm`` and copies it into the least\-significant three bits of integer register \*rd\*, with zero in all other bits\. FSRM swaps the value in frm by copying the original value into integer register \*rd\*, and then writing a new value obtained from the three least\-significant bits of integer register \*rs1\* into ``frm``\. FRFLAGS and FSFLAGS are defined analogously for the Accrued Exception Flags field ``fflags``\.|

## Floating-Point Control and Status Register Register 
### *AddressOffset*: 3 
### *Description*:
The floating-point control and status register, ``fcsr``, is a RISC-V control and status register (CSR). It is a read/write register that selects the dynamic rounding mode for floating-point arithmetic operations and holds the accrued exception flags.

The ``fcsr`` register can be read and written with the FRCSR and FSCSR instructions, which are assembler pseudoinstructions built on the underlying CSR access instructions. FRCSR reads ``fcsr`` by copying it into integer register *rd*. FSCSR swaps the value in ``fcsr`` by copying the original value into integer register *rd*, and then writing a new value obtained from integer register *rs1* into ``fcsr``.

The fields within the ``fcsr`` can also be accessed individually through different CSR addresses, and separate assembler pseudoinstructions are defined for these accesses. The FRRM instruction reads the Rounding Mode field ``frm`` and copies it into the least-significant three bits of integer register *rd*, with zero in all other bits. FSRM swaps the value in frm by copying the original value into integer register *rd*, and then writing a new value obtained from the three least-significant bits of integer register *rs1* into ``frm``. FRFLAGS and FSFLAGS are defined analogously for the Accrued Exception Flags field ``fflags``.
| BIT |  NAME       | displayName        | RIGHT  | Description                                                          |
| --- | ----------- | ------------       | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7:5 | FRM | Floating-point rounding mode | read-write  | Floating\-point operations use either a static rounding mode encoded in the instruction, or a dynamic rounding mode held in ``frm``\. Rounding modes are encoded as shown in the enumerated value\. A value of 111 in the instruction’s \*rm\* field selects the dynamic rounding mode held in ``frm``\. If ``frm`` is set to an invalid value \(101–111\), any subsequent attempt to execute a floating\-point operation with a dynamic rounding mode will raise an illegal instruction exception\. Some instructions, including widening conversions, have the \*rm\* field but are nevertheless unaffected by the rounding mode; software should set their \*rm\* field to RNE \(000\)\.|
| 4 | NV | Invalid operation | read-write  | The accrued exception flags indicate the exception conditions that have arisen on any floating\-point arithmetic instruction since the field was last reset by software\. The base RISC\-V ISA does not support generating a trap on the setting of a floating\-point exception flag\.|

| --- | ----------- | ------------       | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 31 | SD | State dirty | read-only  | The SD bit is a read\-only bit that summarizes whether either the FS, VS, or XS fields signal the presence of some dirty state that will require saving extended user context to memory\. If FS, XS, and VS are all read\-only zero, then SD is also always zero\.|
| 19 | MXR | Make executable readable | read-write  | The MXR bit modifies the privilege with which loads access virtual memory\. When MXR=0, only loads from pages marked readable will succeed\. When MXR=1, loads from pages marked either readable or executable \(R=1 or X=1\) will succeed\. MXR has no effect when page\-based virtual memory is not in effect\.|
| 18 | SUM | Supervisor user memory | read-write  | The SUM \(permit Supervisor User Memory access\) bit modifies the privilege with which S\-mode loads and stores access virtual memory\. When SUM=0, S\-mode memory accesses to pages that are accessible by U\-mode will fault\. When SUM=1, these accesses are permitted\. SUM has no effect when page\-based virtual memory is not in effect\. Note that, while SUM is ordinarily ignored when not executing in S\-mode, it \*is\* in effect when MPRV=1 and MPP=S\. SUM is read\-only 0 if S\-mode is not supported or if ``satp``\.MODE is read\-only 0\.|
| 16:15 | XS | Extension state | read-only  | The XS field is used to reduce the cost of context save and restore by setting and tracking the current state of the user\-mode extensions\. The XS field encodes the status of the additional user\-mode extensions and associated state\.  This field can be checked by a context switch routine to quickly determine whether a state save or restore is required\. If a save or restore is required, additional instructions and CSRs are typically required to effect and optimize the process\.|

This field can be checked by a context switch routine to quickly determine whether a state save or restore is required\. If a save or restore is required, additional instructions and CSRs are typically required to effect and optimize the process\.|
| 8 | SPP | Supervisor mode prior privilege | read-write  | SPP bit indicates the privilege level at which a hart was executing before entering supervisor mode\. When a trap is taken, SPP is set to 0 if the trap originated from user mode, or 1 otherwise\. When an SRET instruction is executed to return from the trap handler, the privilege level is set to user mode if the SPP bit is 0, or supervisor mode if the SPP bit is 1; SPP is then set to 0\.|
| 5 | SPIE | Supervisor mode prior interrupt enable | read-write  | The SPIE bit indicates whether supervisor interrupts were enabled prior to trapping into supervisor mode\. When a trap is taken into supervisor mode, SPIE is set to SIE, and SIE is set to 0\. When an SRET instruction is executed, SIE is set to SPIE, then SPIE is set to 1\.|
| 4 | UPIE |  | read-write  | When a URET instruction is executed, UIE is set to UPIE, and UPIE is set to 1\.|
| 1 | SIE | Supervisor mode interrupt enable | read-write  | The SIE bit enables or disables all interrupts in supervisor mode\. When SIE is clear, interrupts are not taken while in supervisor mode\. When the hart is running in user\-mode, the value in SIE is ignored, and supervisor\-level interrupts are enabled\. The supervisor can disable individual interrupt sources using the ``sie`` CSR\.|
| 0 | UIE |  | read-write  | The UIE bit enables or disables user\-mode interrupts\.|

| BIT |  NAME       | displayName        | RIGHT  | Description                                                          |
| --- | ----------- | ------------       | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 31:2 | BASE |  | read-write  | The BASE field in stvec is a WARL field that can hold any valid virtual or physical address, subject to the following alignment constraints: the address must be 4\-byte aligned, and MODE settings other than Direct might impose additional alignment constraints on the value in the BASE field\.|
| 1:0 | MODE |  | read-write  | When MODE=Direct, all traps into supervisor mode cause the ``pc`` to be set to the address in the BASE field\. When MODE=Vectored, all synchronous exceptions into supervisor mode cause the ``pc`` to be set to the address in the BASE field, whereas interrupts cause the ``pc`` to be set to the address in the BASE field plus four times the interrupt cause number\.|

## Supervisor Exception Program Counter Register 
### *AddressOffset*: 321

### *AddressOffset*: 322 
### *Description*:
When a trap is taken into S-mode, ``scause`` is written with a code indicating the event that caused the trap. Otherwise, ``scause`` is never written by the implementation, though it may be explicitly written by software.
Supervisor cause register (``scause``) values after trap are shown in the following table.

## Supervisor Trap Value Register 
### *AddressOffset*: 323

## Supervisor Address Translation and Protection Register 
### *AddressOffset*: 384 
### *Description*:
The ``satp`` register controls supervisor-mode address translation and protection.

The ``satp`` register is considered active when the effective privilege mode is S-mode or U-mode. Executions of the address-translation algorithm may only begin using a given value of ``satp`` when ``satp`` is active.

.. note::
  Writing ``satp`` does not imply any ordering constraints between page-table updates and subsequent address translations, nor does it imply any invalidation of address-translation caches. If the new address space’s page tables have been modified, or if an ASID is reused, it may be necessary to execute an SFENCE.VMA instruction after, or in some cases before, writing ``satp``.
| BIT |  NAME       | displayName        | RIGHT  | Description                                                          |
| --- | ----------- | ------------       | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 31 | MODE | Mode | read-write  | This bitfield selects the current address\-translation scheme\.  When MODE=Bare, supervisor virtual addresses are equal to supervisor physical addresses, and there is no additional memory protection beyond the physical memory protection scheme\.  To select MODE=Bare, software must write zero to the remaining fields of ``satp`` \(bits 30–0\)\. Attempting to select MODE=Bare with a nonzero pattern in the remaining fields has an ``unspecified`` effect on the value that the remaining fields assume and an ``unspecified`` effect on address translation and protection behavior\.|
| 30:22 | ASID | Address space identifier | read-write  | This bitfield facilitates address\-translation fences on a per\-address\-space basis\.|
| 21:0 | PPN | Physical page number | read-write  | This bitfield holds the root page table, i\.e\., its supervisor physical address divided by 4 KiB\.|

## Machine Status Register 
### *AddressOffset*: 768 
### *Description*:
The ``mstatus`` register keeps track of and controls the hart’s current operating state.
| BIT |  NAME       | displayName        | RIGHT  | Description                                                          |
| --- | ----------- | ------------       | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 31 | SD | State dirty | read-only  | The SD bit is a read\-only bit that summarizes whether either the FS, VS, or XS fields signal the presence of some dirty state that will require saving extended user context to memory\. If FS, XS, and VS are all read\-only zero, then SD is also always zero\.|
| 22 | TSR | Trap sret | read-write  | The TSR bit supports intercepting the supervisor exception return instruction, SRET\. When TSR=1, attempts to execute SRET while executing in S\-mode will raise an illegal instruction exception\. When TSR=0, this operation is permitted in S\-mode\.|
| 21 | TW | Timeout wait | read-write  | The TW bit supports intercepting the WFI instruction\. When TW=0, the WFI instruction may execute in lower privilege modes when not prevented for some other reason\. When TW=1, then if WFI is executed in any less\-privileged mode, and it does not complete within an implementation\-specific, bounded time limit, the WFI instruction causes an illegal instruction exception\. The time limit may always be 0, in which case WFI always causes an illegal instruction exception in less\-privileged modes when TW=1\.|
| 20 | TVM | Trap virtual memory | read-write  | The TVM bit supports intercepting supervisor virtual\-memory management operations\. When TVM=1, attempts to read or write the ``satp`` CSR or execute an SFENCE\.VMA or SINVAL\.VMA instruction while executing in S\-mode will raise an illegal instruction exception\. When TVM=0, these operations are permitted in S\-mode\.|
| 19 | MXR | Make executable readable | read-write  | The MXR bit modifies the privilege with which loads access virtual memory\. When MXR=0, only loads from pages marked readable will succeed\. When MXR=1, loads from pages marked either readable or executable \(R=1 or X=1\) will succeed\. MXR has no effect when page\-based virtual memory is not in effect\.|
| 18 | SUM | Supervisor user memory | read-write  | The SUM \(permit Supervisor User Memory access\) bit modifies the privilege with which S\-mode loads and stores access virtual memory\. When SUM=0, S\-mode memory accesses to pages that are accessible by U\-mode will fault\. When SUM=1, these accesses are permitted\. SUM has no effect when page\-based virtual memory is not in effect\. Note that, while SUM is ordinarily ignored when not executing in S\-mode, it is in effect when MPRV=1 and MPP=S\.|
| 17 | MPRV | Modify privilege | read-write  | The MPRV \(Modify PRiVilege\) bit modifies the effective privilege mode, i\.e\., the privilege level at which loads and stores execute\. When MPRV=0, loads and stores behave as normal, using the translation and protection mechanisms of the current privilege mode\. When MPRV=1, load and store memory addresses are translated and protected, and endianness is applied, as though the current privilege mode were set to MPP\. Instruction address\-translation and protection are unaffected by the setting of MPRV\.|
| 16:15 | XS | Extension state | read-only  | The XS field is used to reduce the cost of context save and restore by setting and tracking the current state of the user\-mode extensions\. The XS field encodes the status of the additional user\-mode extensions and associated state\.  This field can be checked by a context switch routine to quickly determine whether a state save or restore is required\. If a save or restore is required, additional instructions and CSRs are typically required to effect and optimize the process\.|
| 14:13 | FS | Floating-point unit state | read-write  | The FS field is used to reduce the cost of context save and restore by setting and tracking the current state of the floating\-point unit\.
