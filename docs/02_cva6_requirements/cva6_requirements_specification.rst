.. _introduction:

Introduction
============

CVA6 is a RISC-V compatible application processor core that can be
configured as a 32- or 64-bit core (RV32 or RV64). It includes L1
caches, optional MMU, optional PMP and optional FPU.

It is an industrial evolution of ARIANE created by ETH Zürich and the
University of Bologna. It is written in SystemVerilog and maintained by
the OpenHW Group.

This specification is organized as requirements that apply to the “Scope
of the IP”.

The requirement list is to be approved by the OpenHW Group Technical
Work Group (TWG), as well as its change requests.

The specification will be complemented by a user’s guide.

Revision 1.0.0 refers to the product of the first CVA6 project led at
OpenHW Group. It is a placeholder in case of future evolutions after
project freeze (PF gate).

A list of abbreviations is available at the end of this document.

Scope
=====

.. _scope_of_the_ip:

Scope of the IP
---------------

The **scope of the IP** is the subsystem that is specified below and
that will undergo verification with a 100% coverage goal. In the
verification plans, the scope of the IP can be broken down in several
DUT (design under test).

The scope of the IP is the **CVA6 hardware** supporting all the features
used in products based on CVA6.

CVA6 exists in two main configurations: **CV64A6** and **CV32A6**. A
requirement referring to CVA6 applies to both configurations.

|cva6 scope|

As displayed in the picture above, the IP comprises:

-  The CVA6 core;

-  L1 write-through cache;

-  Optional FPU;

-  Optional MMU;

-  Optional PMP;

-  CSR;

-  Performance counters;

-  AXI interface;

-  Interface with the P-Mesh coherence system of OpenPiton.

These are not part of the IP (several solutions can be used):

-  CLINT or PLIC Interrupt modules;

-  Debug module (such as DTM);

-  Support of L1 write-back cache (this might come later as an update).

In addition to these main configurations, several fine grain parameters
are available.

Unless otherwise stated, an optional feature is controlled by a
SystemVerilog parameter. If not selected, the optional feature will not
be present in the netlist after synthesis.

The reader’s attention is drawn to the difference between an optional
feature (“…​shall support as an option…​”) and a desired goal (“…​should
support…​”, “…​should reduce latency…​”).

These are not in the scope of this specification:

-  SW layers, such as compiler and OSes (that can however be part of the
   OpenHW Group CVA6 project);

-  SW emulation of RISC-V optional extensions ( feasible but the scope
   of the IP is the core hardware);

-  Other features included in the testbench (main memory, firmware,
   interconnect…), the verification coverage of which will not be
   measured;

-  The vector coprocessor (CV-VEC) that is planned to interface with
   CV64A6.

.. _verified_configurations:

Initial Release
---------------

The CVA6 is highly configurable via SystemVerilog parameters.
It is not practical to fully document and verify all possible combinations of parameters, so a set of "viable IP configurations" has been defined.
The full list of parameters for this configuration will be detailed in the users’ guide.

Below are the configuration of the first releases of the CVA6.

+--------------------+---------+---------+------+-------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
| Release ID         | Target  | ISA     | XLEN | FPU   | CV-X-IF | MMU     | L1 D$   | L1 I$   |

+--------------------+---------+---------+------+-------+---------+---------+---------+---------+

CV32A60X could evolve to CV32A65X if the team decides to integrate the dual-issue optional architectural feature.

.. _cache_requirements:

Cache requirements
------------------

Caches increase the performance of the processor with regard to memory
accesses. Most of their added value for the IP is specified through
performance requirements in another section. Here below are specific
requirements for these caches.

The project would like to adopt the recently ratified [RVcmo]
specification. The analysis yet needs to be performed and will likely
lead to an evolution of this specification.

.. _l1_write_through_data_cache:

L1 write-through data cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the requirements below, L1WTD refers to the L1 write-through data
cache that is part of the CVA6.

The first two requirements express the write-through feature. Some
requirements are useful for security- and safety-critical applications
where a high level of timing predictability is needed.

Cache counters are defined in the performance counters.

32 kbytes & 4 ways is not feasible with the current architecture. Other
size/ways configurations may be implemented in the design.

.. _fence_t_custom_instruction:

FENCE.T custom instruction
--------------------------

There are discussions within RISC-V International to define a
specification for ``FENCE.T``. The specification below reflects the
situation prior to this RISC-V specification, based on Nils Wistoff’s
work. If a RISC-V specification is ratified, the CVA6 specification will
likely switch to it.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| FET‑10                            | CVA6 shall support the            |
|                                   | ``FENCE.T`` instruction that      |
|                                   | ensures that the execution time   |
|                                   | of subsequent instructions is     |
|                                   | unrelated with predecessor        |
|                                   | instructions.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| FET‑20                            | ``FENCE.T`` shall be available in |
|                                   | all privilege modes (machine,     |
|                                   | supervisor, user and hypervisor   |
|                                   | if present).                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

FENCE.T goes beyond ``FENCE`` and ``FENCE.I`` as it clears L1 caches,
TLB, branch predictors…​ It is a countermeasure for SPECTRE-like
attacks. It is also useful in safety-critical applications to increase
execution time predictability.

It is not yet decided if the ``FENCE.T`` instruction arguments can be
used to select a subset of microarchitecture features that will be
cleared. The list of arguments, if any, will be detailed in the user’s
guide.

Anticipation of verification: It can be cumbersome to prove the timing
decorrelation as expressed in the requirement with digital simulations.
We can simulate the microarchitecture features and explain how they
satisfy the requirement as Nils Wistoff’s work demonstrated.

These PPA targets will likely be updated when performance monitoring is
integrated in the continuous integration flow.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PPA‑10                            | CVA6 should be resource-optimized |
|                                   | on FPGA and ASIC targets.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PPA‑20                            | CVA6 should deliver more than 2.1 |
|                                   | CoreMark/MHz.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PPA‑40                            | CV64A6 should run at more than    |
|                                   | 900 MHz in the cv64a6_imacfd_sv39 |

|                                   | technology in the worst case      |
|                                   | frequency corner with the fastest |
|                                   | threshold voltage.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PPA‑50                            | TBD: Placeholder for              |
|                                   | single-precision floating         |
|                                   | performance per MHz.              |

Interface requirements
======================

.. _memory_bus:

Memory bus
----------

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| MEM‑10                            | CVA6 memory interface shall       |
|                                   | comply with AXI5 specification    |
|                                   | including the Atomic_Transactions |
|                                   | property support as defined in    |
|                                   | [AXI] section E1.1.               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| MEM‑20                            | CVA6 AXI memory interface shall   |
|                                   | feature user bit extensions on    |
|                                   | the data bus (``WUSER`` and       |
|                                   | ``RUSER`` as per [AXI]) in        |
|                                   | connection with the L1I and L1WTD |
|                                   | datasize extensions, with a       |
|                                   | number of user bits greater or    |
|                                   | equal to 0.                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The interface complies with AXI4. However, Atomic_Transactions is only
defined in AXI5. For the sake of clarity, we do not use the AXI5-Lite
interface.

.. _debug:

Debug
-----

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| DBG‑10                            | CVA6 shall implement both the     |
|                                   | Abstracted Command and Execution  |
|                                   | based features outlined in        |
|                                   | chapter 4 of [RVdbg].             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

In addition, there can be an external debug module, not in the scope of
the IP.

.. _interrupts:

Interrupts
----------

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| IRQ‑10                            | CVA6 shall implement interrupt    |
|                                   | handling registers as per the     |
|                                   | RISC-V privilege specification    |
|                                   | and interface with a CLINT        |
|                                   | implementation.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

.. _coprocessor_interface:

Coprocessor interface
---------------------

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| XIF‑10                            | To extend the supported           |
|                                   | instructions, CVA6 shall have a   |
|                                   | coprocessor interface that        |
|                                   | supports the “Issue”, “Commit”    |
|                                   | and “Result” interfaces of the    |
|                                   | [CV-X-IF] specification.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The goal is to have a compatible interface between CORE-V cores (CVA6,
CV32E40X…). The feasibility still needs to be confirmed; including the
speculative execution.

CVA6 can interface with several coprocessors simultaneously through a
specific external feature implemented on the CV-X-IF interface.

.. _multi_core_interface:

Multi-core interface
--------------------

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| TRI‑10                            | CVA6 shall have the               |
|                                   | Transaction-Response Interface    |
|                                   | (TRI) needed to interface with    |
|                                   | the P-Mesh coherence system of    |
|                                   | OpenPiton, according to           |
|                                   | [OpenPiton].                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

.. _design_rules:

Design rules
============

As different teams have different design rules and to ease the
integration in FPGA and ASIC design flows:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| RUL‑10                            | CVA6 should have a configurable   |
|                                   | reset signal:                     |
|                                   | synchronous/asynchronous, active  |
|                                   | on high or low levels.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| RUL‑20                            | CVA6 shall be a super-synchronous |
|                                   | design with a single clock input. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| RUL‑30                            | CVA6 should not include           |
|                                   | multi-cycle paths.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| RUL‑40                            | CVA6 should not include           |
|                                   | technology-dependent blocks.      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

If technology-dependent blocks are used, e.g. to improve PPA on certain
targets, the equivalent technology-independent block should be
available. Parameters can be used to select between the implementations.
