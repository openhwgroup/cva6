Work In Progress
----------------
This document is a work in progress and the team currently drafting it focuses on its use to verify several configurations of CVA6.

The current limitation of documentation on CVA6 is well understood.
Rather than regretting this, the reader is encouraged to contribute to it to make CVA6 an even better core.
To contribute to the project, refer to the Contributing_ guidelines and get in touch with the team.

Target Audience
---------------
The CVA6 user manual targets:

* SW programmers
* HW designers who integrate CVA6 into a SoC/ASIC/FPGA
* Architects who design a coprocessor for the CV-X-IF interface and who need to create SW to use it
* HW designers who synthetize/place&route/verify a design that embeds CVA6
* Verification engineers involved in the OpenHW Group’s CVA6 project who use this manual as a reference.

The user guide does not target people who dig into CVA6 design. No internal mechanisms are described here,
except if the user has some sort of control on it. A separate design document digs into the core microarchitecture.

CVA6 Overview
--------------
**CVA6** is a RISC-V compatible application processor core that can be configured
as a 32- or 64-bit core: **CV32A6** and **CV64A6**.

CVA6 can be configured to the users' and application needs thanks to several
parameters and optional features (MMU, PMP, FPU, cache organization and size...).
It targets **FPGA** and **ASIC** technologies.

CVA6, as an application core, can run many operating systems. It has already been
demonstrated with embedded **Linux** distributions (built with **BuildRoot** and
**Yocto**), **FreeRTOS** and **Zephyr**.

CVA6 features the **CV-X-IF** coprocessor interface to extend the set of instructions it can execute.

The goal of CVA6 is to be **fully compliant** with RISC-V specifications and feature no or extremely
few custom extensions (except through extensions on CV-X-IF interface).

CV32A6 and CV64A6 share the same **SystemVerilog** source code, available in this GitHub_ repository.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/

CV64A6 is an industrial evolution of ARIANE created by ETH Zürich and the
University of Bologna. CV32A6 is a later addition by Thales. CVA6 is now
curated at the OpenHW Group by its members.

Configurations
--------------

CVA6 is actually a family of cores, as CVA6 can be configured to the users' needs with more than 50 parameters.
A configuration is defined as a given set of parameters.

A few configurations undergo a complete verification process to bring them to **TRL-5**,
the maturity level where they can be integrated in production ASICs.

This manual includes generic descriptions of CVA6 capabilities, as well as their applicability to
the verified configurations.

As of today, two configurations are being verified and addressed in this document:

.. csv-table::
   :widths: auto
   :align: left
   :header: "Configuration", "Short description", "Target", "Privilege levels", "Supported RISC-V ISA", "CV-X-IF"

   "**CV32A60AX**", "32-bit **application** core", "ASIC", "Machine, Supervisor, User", "RV32IMACZicsr_Zifencei_Zicount_Zba_Zbb_Zbc_Zbs_Zcb_Zicond", "Included"
   "**CV32A60X**", "32-bit **embedded** core", "ASIC", "Machine only", "RV32IMCZicsr_Zifencei_Zba_Zbb_Zbc_Zbs_Zcb", "Included"

CV32A60X is an interim part number until the team can decide if this configuration is single- or dual-issue.
If the dual-issue architecture is selected, the part number will become CV32A65X to denote the extra performance.

In the future, dedicated user manuals for each configuration could be generated. The team is looking for a contributor to implement this through *templating*.

Scope of the IP
---------------

The **scope of the IP** refers the subsystem that is documented here.

.. image:: ../02_cva6_requirements/images/cva6_scope.png

As displayed in the picture above, the IP comprises:

-  The CVA6 core;
-  L1 write-through cache;
-  Optional FPU;
-  Optional MMU;
-  Optional PMP;
-  CSR;
-  Performance counters;
-  AXI interface;
-  Interface with the P-Mesh coherence system of OpenPiton;
-  CV-X-IF coprocessor interface (not shown).

These are not part of the IP (several solutions can be used):

-  CLINT or PLIC Interrupt modules;
-  Debug module (such as DTM);
-  Support of L1 write-back cache.
