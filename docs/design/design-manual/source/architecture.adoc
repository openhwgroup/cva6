Architecture and Modules
------------------------

The {ohg-config} is fully synthesizable. It has been designed mainly for ASIC designs, but FPGA synthesis is supported as well.

For ASIC synthesis, the whole design is completely synchronous and uses positive-edge triggered flip-flops. The core occupies an area of about 80 kGE. The clock frequency can be more than 1 GHz depending of technology.

The {ohg-config} subsystem is composed of 8 modules.

Connections between modules are illustrated in the following block diagram. FRONTEND, DECODE, ISSUE, EXECUTE, COMMIT and CONTROLLER are part of the pipeline. The CSRFILE contains the registers.
