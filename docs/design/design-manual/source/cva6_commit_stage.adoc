[[CVA6_COMMIT_STAGE]]
COMMIT_STAGE Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[commit_stage-description]]
Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

The COMMIT_STAGE module implements the commit stage, which is the last
stage in the processorâ€™s pipeline. For the instructions for which the
execution is completed, it updates the architectural state: writing CSR
registers, committing stores and writing back data to the register file.
The commit stage controls the stalling and the flushing of the
processor.

The commit stage also manages the exceptions. An exception can occur
during the first four pipeline stages (PCgen cannot generate an
exception) or happen in commit stage, coming from the CSR_REGFILE or
from an interrupt. Exceptions are precise: they are considered during
the commit only and associated with the related instruction.
