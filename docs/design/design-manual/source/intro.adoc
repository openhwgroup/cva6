[[introduction]]
Introduction
------------

The OpenHW Group uses https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] to
describe the release status of its IP. This document describes the
{ohg-config} configuration version of CVA6. This intends to be the first
formal release of CVA6.

CVA6 is a 6-stage in-order and single issue processor core which
implements the RISC-V instruction set. CVA6 can be configured as a 32-
or 64-bit core (RV32 or RV64), called CV32A6 or CV64A6.

The objective of this document is to provide enough information to allow
the RTL modification (by designers) and the RTL verification (by
verificators). This document is not dedicated to CVA6 users looking for
information to develop software like instructions or registers.

The CVA6 architecture is illustrated in the following figure.

{ohg-config} is a standards-compliant {XLEN}-bit processor fully compliant with
above specifications. In the meanwhile, the conformity of {ohg-config} versus
[RVcompat] has not been tested.

[[documentation-framework]]
Documentation framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The framework of this document is inspired by the Common Criteria. The
Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (referred
to as Common Criteria or CC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC
15408) for computer security certification.

Description of the framework:

* Processor is split into modules corresponding to the main modules of
the design
* Modules can contain several modules
* Each module is described in a chapter, which contains the following
subchapters: _Description_, _Functionalities_, _Architecture and
Modules_ and _Registers_ (if any)
* The subchapter _Description_ describes the main features of the
submodule, the interconnections between the current module and the
others and the inputs/outputs interface.
* The subchapter _Functionality_ lists in details the module
functionalities. Please avoid using the RTL signal names to explain the
functionalities.
* The subchapter _Architecture and Modules_ provides a drawing to
present the module hierarchy, then the functionalities covered by the
module
* The subchapter _Registers_ specifies the module registers if any
