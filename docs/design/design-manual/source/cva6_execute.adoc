[[CVA6_EX_STAGE]]

EX_STAGE Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[ex_stage-description]]
Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

The EX_STAGE module is a logical stage which implements the execute stage.
It encapsulates the following functional units: ALU, Branch Unit, CSR buffer, Mult, load and store and CVXIF.

The module is connected to:

* ID_STAGE module provides scoreboard entry.
*

[[alu]]
alu
+++

The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a small piece of hardware which performs 32 and 64-bit arithmetic and bitwise operations: subtraction, addition, shifts, comparisons...
It always completes its operation in a single cycle.

include::port_alu.adoc[]

[[branch_unit]]
branch_unit
+++++++++++

The branch unit module manages all kinds of control flow changes i.e.: conditional and unconditional jumps.
It calculates the target address and decides whether to take the branch or not.
It also decides if a branch was mis-predicted or not and reports corrective actions to the pipeline stages.

include::port_branch_unit.adoc[]

[[csr_buffer]]
CSR_buffer
++++++++++

The CSR buffer module stores the CSR address at which the instruction is going to read/write.
As the CSR instruction alters the processor architectural state, this instruction has to be buffered until the commit stage decides to execute the instruction.

include::port_csr_buffer.adoc[]

[[mult]]
mult
++++

The multiplier module supports the division and multiplication operations.

include::port_mult.adoc[]

[[multiplier]]
====== multiplier

Multiplication is performed in two cycles and is fully pipelined.

include::port_multiplier.adoc[]

[[serdiv]]
====== serdiv

The division is a simple serial divider which needs 64 cycles in the worst case.

include::port_serdiv.adoc[]

[[load_store_unit-lsu]]
load_store_unit (LSU)
+++++++++++++++++++++

The load store module interfaces with the data cache (D$) to manage the load and store operations.

The LSU does not handle misaligned accesses.
Misaligned accesses are double word accesses which are not aligned to a 64-bit boundary, word accesses which are not aligned to a 32-bit boundary and half word accesses which are not aligned on 16-bit boundary.
If the LSU encounters a misaligned load or store, it throws a misaligned exception.

include::port_load_store_unit.adoc[]

[[store_unit]]
====== store_unit

The store_unit module manages the data store operations.

As stores can be speculative, the store instructions need to be committed by ISSUE_STAGE module before possibily altering the processor state.
Store buffer keeps track of store requests.
Outstanding store instructions (which are speculative) are differentiated from committed stores.
When ISSUE_STAGE module commits a store instruction, outstanding stores
become committed.

When commit buffer is not empty, the buffer automatically tries to write the oldest store to the data cache.

Furthermore, the store_unit module provides information to the load_unit to know if an outstanding store matches addresses with a load.

include::port_store_unit.adoc[]

[[load_unit]]
====== load_unit

The load unit module manages the data load operations.

Before issuing a load, the load unit needs to check the store buffer for potential aliasing.
It stalls until it can satisfy the current request. This means:

* Two loads to the same address are allowed.
* Two stores to the same address are allowed.
* A store after a load to the same address is allowed.
* A load after a store to the same address can only be processed if the store has already been sent to the cache i.e there is no fowarding.

After the check of the store buffer, a read request is sent to the D$ with the index field of the address (1).
The load unit stalls until the D$ acknowledges this request (2).
In the next cycle, the tag field of the address is sent to the D$ (3).
If the load request address is non-idempotent, it stalls until the write buffer of the D$ is empty of non-idempotent requests and the store buffer is empty.
It also stalls until the incoming load instruction is the next instruction to be committed.
When the D$ allows the read of the data, the data is sent to the load unit and the load instruction can be committed (4).

[[lsu_bypass]]
====== lsu_bypass

The LSU bypass is a FIFO which keeps instructions from the issue stage when the store unit or the load unit are not available immediately.
