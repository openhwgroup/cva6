Global functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {ohg-config} is a subsystem composed of the modules and protocol interfaces
as illustrated. The processor is a Harvard-based modern architecture.
Instructions are issued in-order through the DECODE stage and executed
out-of-order but committed in-order. The processor is Single issue, that
means that at maximum one instruction per cycle can be issued to the
EXECUTE stage.

The CVA6 implements a 6-stage pipeline composed of PC Generation,
Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Issue stage, Execute stage and
Commit stage. At least 6 cycles are needed to execute one instruction.

Connection with other sub-systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The submodule is connected to:

* OBI interconnect gives access to memory content
* COPROCESSOR connects through CV-X-IF coprocessor interface protocol
* TRAP provides traps inputs
