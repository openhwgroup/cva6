\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

The RISC-V \textit{Efficient Trace} (E-Trace) specification offers a standardized and efficient 
branch tracing mechanism, defining algorithms, input ports, and trace output formats. However, 
while the Trace Encoder (TE) can produce trace packets as per the specification, its output 
remains inaccessible outside simulation environments.  

To bridge this gap, the RISC-V consortium introduced the \textit{Unformatted Trace \& Diagnostic 
Data Packet Encapsulation for RISC-V}, a module that transforms TE output into standardized 
packets suitable for off-chip transmission.
For our specific use case, the \textit{ARM Trace Bus} (ATB) protocol was selected as the output 
format, owing to its suitability for trace data transport and seamless conversion to advanced 
protocols like AXI and PCIe for debugging purposes.  

The resulting architecture is modular and designed for adaptability, enabling easy integration 
with alternative communication protocols as required. This work provides an efficient and 
flexible solution for trace data handling, facilitating the extraction of real-time tracing data 
in modern RISC-V-based systems.
