# CLINT (Core-local Interrupt Controller)

This repository contains a RISC-V privilege spec 1.11 (WIP) compatible CLINT for the Ariane Core.

The CLINT plugs into an existing AXI Bus with an AXI 4 Lite interface. The IP mirrors transaction IDs and is fully pin-compatible with the full AXI 4 interface. It does not support burst transfers (as specified in the AMBA 4 Bus specification)
