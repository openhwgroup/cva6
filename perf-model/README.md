# CVA6 cycle-accurate performance model

This repository contains a cycle-accurate performance model of CVA6 control-path.

It was developed to explore microarchitecture changes in CVA6 before implementing them.

To cite this model, please head to the end of this document.


## Getting started

### Generate an RVFI trace

To generate an RVFI trace, follow the instructions in the CVA6 repository to run a simulation.
The RVFI trace will be in `verif/sim/out_<date>/<simulator>/<test-name>.log`.


### Running the model

```bash
python3 model.py verif/sim/out_<date>/<simulator>/<test-name>.log
```

The annotated trace is generated in an `annotated.log` file in the current directory.

It prints a lot of debug information so that you can see all the events (note: it slows down model execution).
To disable these prints, modify the instantiation with `Model(debug=False)` in the `main` function.

At the end of the simulation, the model prints statistics with the `print_stats` call in the `main` function.
These statistics can be performed on the timed part, which is filtered with the `filter_timed_part` function.
Feel free to modify the `filter_timed_part` function to suit your needs.


### Exploring design space

In `model.py`, the `main` function runs the model with arguments which override default values.
Generic parameters are available in `Model.__init__`.
You can add new parameters to explore here.

To perform exploration, run the model in a loop, like `issue_commit_graph` does.
The `display_scores` function is meant to print a 3D plot if you have `matplotlib`.
`issue_commit_graph` prints the scores so that you can store it and display the figure without re-running the model.


## Comparing the model and the RTL

### Adapt RVFI trace generation

The regular expression expects the cycle number to be in the RVFI trace.
The value is not used by the model but it is used to compare the model and CVA6.

To emit cycle number in RVFI trace, modify `corev_apu/tb/rvfi_tracer.sv` in CVA6 repository as below.

```diff
-        $fwrite(f, "core   0: 0x%h (0x%h) DASM(%h)\n",
-          pc64, rvfi_i[i].insn, rvfi_i[i].insn);
+        $fwrite(f, "core   0: 0x%h (0x%h) @%d DASM(%h)\n",
+          pc64, rvfi_i[i].insn, cycles, rvfi_i[i].insn);
```


### Calculate instruction duration

Run `cycle_diff.py` for each script.

```bash
python3 perf-model/cycle_diff.py annotated.log
mv traceout.log model.log
python3 perf-model/cycle_diff.py verif/sim/out_<date>/<simulator>/<test-name>.log
```

Note: the `cycles_diff.py` script filters the "timed" part of the program.
To do this, it tries to find `csrr minstret` instructions.
Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs.


### List the differences

```bash
diff -y traceout.log model.log | less
```
