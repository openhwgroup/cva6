# Code Coverage Scope Specification file for DSIM
#
# Example from DSIM User Manual: path top.testbench.dut +
#
# We want to instrument and collect code coverage for the CORE and all levels
# of hierarchy below the top of the core. Also, in the DSIM compile-time args,
# top is defined as uvmt_cv32_tb, so compile-time command looks something like:
# 
#  dsim -top uvmt_cv32_tb \
#       -code-cov block \
#       -code-cov-scope-specs ccov_scopes.txt \
#       -f $(MANIFEST)
#
path uvmt_cv32e40p_tb.dut_wrap.cv32e40p_wrapper_i.core_i +
