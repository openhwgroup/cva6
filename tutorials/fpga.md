# COREV-APU FPGA Emulation

We currently provide support for the [Genesys 2 board](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/genesys-2/reference-manual) and the [Agilex 7 Development Kit](https://www.intel.la/content/www/xl/es/products/details/fpga/development-kits/agilex/agf014.html).

- **Genesys 2**

    We provide pre-build bitstream and memory configuration files for the Genesys 2 [here](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/releases).

    Tested on Vivado 2018.2. The FPGA currently contains the following peripherals:

   - DDR3 memory controller
   - SPI controller to connect to an SDCard
   - Ethernet controller
   - JTAG port (see debugging section below)
   - Bootrom containing zero stage bootloader and device tree.
   - UART
   - GPIOs connected to LEDs

> The ethernet controller and the corresponding network connection is still work in progress and not functional at the moment. Expect some updates soon-ish.

- **Agilex 7**

   Tested on Quartus Prime Version 24.1.0 Pro Edition. The FPGA currently contains the following peripherals:

   - DDR4 memory controller
   - JTAG port (see debugging section below)
   - Bootrom containing zero stage bootloader
   - UART
   - GPIOs connected to LEDs

> The ethernet controller and the corresponding network connection, as well as the SD Card connection and the capability to boot linux are still work in progress and not functional at the moment. Expect some updates soon-ish.


## Programming the Memory Configuration File or bitstream

- **Genesys 2**

   - Open Vivado 2018.2
   - Open the hardware manager and open the target board (Genesys II - `xc7k325t`)
   - Tools - Add Configuration Memory Device
   - Select the following Spansion SPI flash `s25fl256xxxxxx0`
   - Add `ariane_xilinx.mcs`
   - Press Ok. Flashing will take a couple of minutes.
   - Right click on the FPGA device - Boot from Configuration Memory Device (or press the program button on the FPGA)

- **Agilex 7**

   - Open Quartus programmer
   - Configure HW Setup by selecting the AGF FPGA Development Kit
   - Click Auto-Detect to scan the JTAG chain
   - In the device list, right click over device AGFB014R24B and add file (.sof)
   - Click on Start button to program the FPGA
   - Right now only baremetal is supported, so right after programming you can connect to the UART and see your CVA6 alive on Agilex!
   - For this you need to use the JTAG UART provided with Quartus installation

```
.$quartus_installation_path/qprogrammer/quartus/bin/juart-terminal
juart-terminal: connected to hardware target using JTAG UART on cable
juart-terminal: "AGF FPGA Development Kit [1-3]", device 1, instance 0
juart-terminal: (Use the IDE stop button or Ctrl-C to terminate)

Hello World!
```

## Booting Linux

The first stage bootloader will boot from SD Card by default. Get yourself a suitable SD Card (we use [this](https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Digital-Mobility-MBLY10G2-32GB/dp/B00519BEQO) one). Either grab a pre-built Linux image from [here](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane-sdk/releases) or generate the Linux image yourself following the README in the [ariane-sdk repository](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane-sdk). Prepare the SD Card by following the "Booting from SD card" section in the ariane-sdk repository.

Connect a terminal to the USB serial device opened by the FTDI chip e.g.:
```
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

Default baudrate set by the bootloader and Linux is `115200`.

After you've inserted the SD Card and programmed the FPGA you can connect to the serial port of the FPGA and should see the bootloader and afterwards Linux booting. Default username is `root`, no password required.

## Booting zephyr RTOS

[zephyr](https://zephyrproject.org/) is a real-time unikernel operating system developed by the Linux Foundation that targets resource-constrained embedded devices. It is highly configurable and optionally provides subsystems like userspace support with the PMP, a full network stack and a file system.

zephyr natively supports the cva6 SoC and the **Genesys 2** board in two configurations: [cv64a6_imafdc_sv39](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/openhwgroup/cv64a6_genesys_2/doc/index.html) and [cv32a6_imac_sv32](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/openhwgroup/cv32a6_genesys_2/doc/index.html).
See the 
`cv64a6_imafdc_sv39` is the configuration that will be synthesized when you follow the steps [below](#generating-a-bitstream).
In order to build `cv32a6_imac_sv32`, use the following command instead:
```bash
target=cv32a6_imac_sv32 make fpga
```

In order to build a zephyr application, follow the [zephyr getting started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) to setup the build dependencies and install zephyr's meta tool *west*.
You can then build zephyr applications using the standard process:
```bash
west build -p -b cv64a6_genesys_2 samples/hello_world # for cv64a6_imafdc_sv39
west build -p -b cv32a6_genesys_2 samples/hello_world # for cv32a6_imac_sv32
```


You can use zephyr's *west* to debug or flash the application via openocd, akin to [the instructions below](#debugging):
```bash
west flash # loads the application into memory and runs it
west debug # launches an interactive GDB console that loads the application and stops at the first instruction
west attach # attaches to an application loaded using "west load"
```

Alternatively, similar to the [Linux instructions](#booting-linux), you may load zephyr from an SD card.
To this end, *after building the application*, use the provided script:
```bash
./util/write-zephyr-sd.sh /dev/sdXXX /path/to/zephyrproject/zephyr # provide correct SD card device and path to top level of cloned zephyrproject/zephyr repository
```
**WARNING: The script will wipe the partition table and destroy all data on the SD card. Double-check the device path before running the script.**

You can then insert the SD card into the board and have the zero-stage boot loader load and run zephyr.



## Generating a Bitstream

- **Genesys 2**

To generate the FPGA bitstream (and memory configuration) yourself for the Genesys II board run:

```
make fpga
```

This will produce a bitstream file and memory configuration file (in `fpga/work-fpga`) which you can permanently flash by running the above commands.

- **Agilex 7**

To generate the FPGA bitstream yourself for the Agilex 7 board run:

```
make altera
```

We recommend to set the parameter FpgaAlteraEn (and also FpgaEn) to benefit from the FPGA optimizations.

This will produce a bitstream file (in `altera/output_files`) which you can program following the previous instructions. **Note: Bear in mind that you need a Quartus Pro Licence to be able to generate this bitstream**

To clean the project after generating the bitstream, use

```
make clean-altera
```

## Debugging

- **Genesys 2**
You can debug (and program) the FPGA using [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/doc/html/Architecture-and-Core-Commands.html). We provide two example scripts for OpenOCD below.

To get started, connect the micro USB port that is labeled with JTAG to your machine. This port is attached to the FTDI 2232 USB-to-serial chip on the Genesys 2 board, and is usually used to access the native JTAG interface of the Kintex-7 FPGA (e.g. to program the device using Vivado 2018.2). However, the FTDI chip also exposes a second serial link that is routed to GPIO pins on the FPGA, and we leverage this to wire up the JTAG from the RISC-V debug module.

>If you are on an Ubuntu based system you need to add the following udev rule to `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-ftdi.rules`
>```
> SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6010", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"
>```

Once attached to your system, the FTDI chip should be listed when you type `lsusb`:

```
Bus 005 Device 019: ID 0403:6010 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT2232C/D/H Dual UART/FIFO IC
```

If this is the case, you can go on and start openocd with the `fpga/ariane.cfg` configuration file:

```
openocd -f fpga/ariane.cfg

- **Agilex 7**

You can debug (and program) the FPGA using a modified version of OpenOCD included with Quartus installation ($quartus_installation_path/qprogrammer/quartus/bin/openocd).

To get started, connect the micro USB port that is labeled with J13 to your machine. It is the same port that is used for the UART. Both use the JTAG interface and connect to the System Level Debugging (SLD) Hub instantiated inside the FPGA. Then the debugger connection goes to the virtual JTAG IP (vJTAG) which can be accessed with the modified version of OpenOCD.

You can start openocd with the `altera/cva6.cfg` configuration file:

```

## Preliminary Support for OpenPiton Cache System

CVA6 has preliminary support for the OpenPiton distributed cache system from Princeton University. To this end, a different L1 cache subsystem (`src/cache_subsystem/wt_cache_subsystem.sv`) has been developed that follows a write-through protocol and that has support for cache invalidations and atomics.

The corresponding integration patches will be released on [OpenPiton GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/openpiton). Check the `README` in that repository to see how to use CVA6 in the OpenPiton setting.

To activate the different cache system, compile your code with the macro `DCACHE_TYPE`.


## Re-generating the Bootcode (ZSBL)

The zero stage bootloader (ZSBL) for RTL simulation lives in `bootrom/` while the bootcode for the FPGA is in `fpga/src/bootrom`. The RTL bootcode simply jumps to the base of the DRAM where the FSBL takes over. For the FPGA the ZSBL performs additional housekeeping. Both bootloader pass the hartid as well as address to the device tree in argument register `a0` and `a1` respectively.

To re-generate the bootcode you can use the existing makefile within those directories. To generate the SystemVerilog files you will need the `bitstring` python package installed on your system.
